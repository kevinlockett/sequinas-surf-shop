Sequina's Surf Shop

In this project, you will be debugging code that another developer has previously written. Your job is to use your debugger skills to understand where the error occurred, understand the error message itself, find a resolution for the error, and then test your solution.

Sequina Kaâ€™uhane grew up with the ocean. From her earliest memories, she can recall the sounds and smells of the beach, and the taste of the salty ocean air. When she was just 11 years old, she learned how to surf, and thus begun her love affair with the sport.

After finishing university with a master's degree in business administration and marketing, she opened her own shop to sell surfing equipment and training for her local community.

She has contracted you to help manage the inventory of her business.
